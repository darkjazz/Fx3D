\f0\fs24 \cf0 f(x) is an audiovisual exploration of 3-dimensional continuous spatial functions derived from the concept of continuous valued cellular automata. The functions form the basis for sound and visual synthesis mappings that create a complex parameter network. The audio and the visuals are independent from each other both physically and conceptually and the reciprocal influence flows in boths ways in a non-linear manner. The spatial functions and visuals have been implemented as a separate Cocoa OpenGL application. The segmentation of the visual space and acoustic time is controlled in the performance by affecting the behavior of the automata world in real time to reveal the complex, organic three-dimensional patterns that emerge and modifying the mapping space in response to them.  }
